This project explores different implementations and optimizations of binary search trees and 2D binary search trees. It includes functions such as bstRangeSearch, pdctCreate, and pdctBallSearch, and compares their performance in terms of time and space complexity. The empirical results highlight the advantages of using 2D BSTs for large datasets, providing insights into the efficiency of different data structures for various types of search queries. The project also identifies the area in Porto with the highest density of taxis, demonstrating a practical application of the algorithms.
